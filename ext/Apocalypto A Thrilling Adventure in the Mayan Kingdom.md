The next day, Jaguar Paw's village is attacked by a group of warriors led by Zero Wolf (Raoul Trujillo), who are looking for captives to sacrifice to the Mayan gods. Jaguar Paw manages to hide his pregnant wife Seven (Dalia HernÃ¡ndez) and their young son in a deep pit near their hut, but he is captured along with many others. His father is killed by Zero Wolf's son Cut Rock (Ricardo Diaz Mendoza), who also takes Jaguar Paw's jade pendant as a trophy.
 
The captives are taken to the Mayan city, where they witness a solar eclipse and the ritual sacrifice of some of their fellow villagers. Jaguar Paw is spared from being killed by the high priest when the eclipse ends and the crowd cheers. He is then taken to a gladiatorial arena, where he and the remaining captives are forced to run for their lives while being attacked by Zero Wolf and his men. Jaguar Paw manages to kill Cut Rock with his own pendant and escapes into the jungle, pursued by Zero Wolf and his warriors.
 
Jaguar Paw uses his hunting skills and knowledge of the terrain to evade and kill his pursuers one by one. He also encounters a group of Spanish conquistadors who have arrived on the shore with a large cross. He reaches his village and rescues his wife and son, who have given birth to another son in the pit. He then leads them to a hidden waterfall, where he decides to start a new life with his family. He also sees the Spanish ships approaching the coast, but chooses to ignore them and stay in the jungle.
